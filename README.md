Me and my team, CØDE BREAKERS, recently took part in Operation Intercept 2025, and wow — this was no ordinary CTF. From start to finish, it felt like a real-world simulation where every challenge was part of a bigger, hidden story waiting to be uncovered.

The event kicked off at 9 PM and ran until 9 PM on August 31st, hosted by HackKap. The challenges were diverse and demanding, covering:

    Web Exploitation

    Cryptography

    Forensics

    Steganography

    ICS/SCADA (industrial control systems, which added a cool real-world touch)

What really set this event apart was how every detail mattered. You couldn’t just rush through — each puzzle piece helped reveal the bigger picture. Careful reading and understanding the clues (enunciation!) were absolutely key.

In this repo, I’m sharing the walkthroughs and solutions from the challenges our team cracked during the event. We hope it helps others learn and get inspired by the approach we took.

Huge shoutout to HackKap for putting together such a unique and immersive experience. If you’re looking for a CTF that pushes you beyond the usual flag hunt, this is definitely one to watch.

Keep breaking codes and pushing limits!
